        "commands in SQL. Provide one example for each type of command.\n",
        "\n",
        "> SQL commands are categorized based on the type of operation they perform on a database. Data Definition Language, Data Manipulation Language, and Data Query Language are three major classifications that together cover the complete lifecycle of database usage. Data Definition Language, commonly known as DDL, is used to define and manage the structure of database objects. Commands such as CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE fall under DDL and are responsible for creating new tables, modifying existing table structures, or deleting database objects entirely. For example, when a table is created to store employee information, the CREATE TABLE command defines column names, data types, and constraints, thereby shaping how data will be stored.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Data Manipulation Language, or DML, is used to manage the actual data stored inside the database tables. These commands allow users to insert new records, update existing records, or delete unwanted data. INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are typical DML commands. For instance, when a new employee joins an organization, the INSERT command is used to add that employee’s details into the Employees table. Unlike DDL, DML commands can usually be rolled back if executed within a transaction, which makes them safer for data handling.\n",
        "\n",
        ">Data Query Language, abbreviated as DQL, is focused entirely on retrieving data from the database without altering it. The SELECT command is the primary DQL command and is used extensively in reporting, analysis, and decision-making. By applying conditions using the WHERE clause, users can fetch specific records from large datasets. For example, selecting employees whose salary exceeds a certain amount helps management analyze high-earning employees without changing any stored data. Together, DDL, DML, and DQL form the foundation of SQL operations, ensuring structured storage, controlled data manipulation, and efficient data retrieval.\n",

        ">SQL constraints are used in databases to maintain data accuracy, consistency, and integrity. Their main purpose is to restrict invalid data entry and ensure that the data stored follows predefined business rules. Constraints are applied at the column or table level and automatically enforce conditions whenever data is inserted, updated, or deleted. Without constraints, databases may contain duplicate records, missing values, or incorrect relationships between tables, which can lead to unreliable results during analysis or reporting.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most important constraints is the PRIMARY KEY constraint, which ensures that each record in a table is uniquely identifiable. It does not allow duplicate values or NULL values. For example, in a Customers table, each customer must have a unique customer ID so that no two customers can be confused. This can be implemented using SQL as shown below.\n",

        ">Normalization in SQL is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The primary objective of normalization is to eliminate duplicate data, ensure logical data storage, and minimize data anomalies that occur during insert, update, or delete operations. By structuring data efficiently, normalization makes databases easier to maintain and more reliable for analysis.\n",

This means that each field should store only a single value, and there should be no multi-valued attributes. For example, storing multiple phone numbers in a single column violates 1NF and should instead be split into separate rows or tables.\n",
